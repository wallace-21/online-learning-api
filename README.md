<h1>Online Learning API</h1>
<p>With numerous organizations like Meta, Amazon, Google, IBM, and ALX offering online courses, the landscape of online education is rapidly expanding. This growing diversity in online learning platforms presents a unique opportunity. To support developers who aim to integrate educational content seamlessly into their applications, I decided to create an API that simplifies and accelerates the development process. This API will streamline access to a wide range of online courses, ultimately saving developers valuable time and effort.</p>
